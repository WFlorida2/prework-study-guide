Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

Some questions:
1. How to remove a file that was created during creation of a repo?
2. When setting up the .ssh/config file , I came across the following:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/using-ssh-agent-forwarding

Warning: You may be tempted to use a wildcard like Host * to just apply this setting to all SSH connections. That's not really a good idea, as you'd be sharing your local SSH keys with every server you SSH into. They won't have direct access to the keys, but they will be able to use them as you while the connection is established. You should only add servers you trust and that you intend to use with agent forwarding.

In that case above, what are the server we will be using that we trust?

3. After setting the ssh key, why I can not see the option to use ssh during login to Github?
4. When opening the VS Code from CLI in Mac, Explorer is not displayed and the prework-study-guide repo not displayed to?
5. Find and educate myself more on "Branching"
