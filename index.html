     <ul>
      <li>What have I learned so far?</li>
      <li>Think about when developing a webpage is building a sturdy "frame" using HTML, then, using CSS, start thinking about the colors and styles you might want to add to make it uniquely your own.Finaly, add JS to finally enable you and the user to interact with it</li>
      <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li> 
      <li>The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages (Text elements, Image elements, Header elements, List elements)</li>
      <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
      <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
      <li>The element that holds all the children known as the parent element</li>
      <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag</li>
      <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
      <li>When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices</li>
      <li>The biggest heading, h1, should only appear once on each page</li>
      <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>What have I learned so far?</li>
       <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
       <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
       <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
       <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
       <ol> example :?  h1 style="color:red;" Prework Study Guide </ol>
       <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
       <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
       <ol>It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</ol>
       <ol>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head, </ol>
       <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
       <ol>Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</ol>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>Learned how elements can be positioned with CSS</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>What have I learned so far?</li>
          <li>Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files</li>
          <li>usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development</li>
          <li>Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows</li>
          <li>An SSH key is an access credential for the SSH (secure shell) network protocol</li>
          <li>This authenticated and encrypted secure network protocol is used for remote communication between machines on an unsecured open network</li>
          <li>SSH is used for remote file transfer, network management, and remote operating system access</li>
          <p>
            <li>Learned how to create an SSH Key. For more info, please visit Github online notes</li>
            <br>
          <li>Follow these steps to generate an SSH key on MAC:
            <ol>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</ol>
            <ol>You will then be prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key."</ol>
            <ol>You can specify a file location or press “Enter” to accept the default file location.</ol>
            <ol>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]</ol>
            <ol>Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]</ol>
          </p>
          
           <p>To add the new SSH key to the ssh-agent,do the following:</p> 
            <li>First ensure the ssh-agent is running by executing:</li>
            <ol>$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"</ol>
            <ol>Once the ssh-agent is running the following command will add the new SSH key to the local SSH agent:</ol>
            <ol>ssh-add -K /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa</ol>
            <ol>Now, the new SSH key is registered and ready to use!</ol>
            <p>To add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain, type</p> 
            <ol>ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</ol>
            <br>Follow these instructions to add the SSH public key to your account on GitHub. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">"Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account."</a>
            <ol>Remember that it's important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub</ol>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>What have I learned so far?</li>
       <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites. One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values.</li>
       <li>You can add a variable that stores a string that contains a list of prework topics</li>
       <li>We used Chrome DevTools to demonstrate how console.log works and to confirm that the script tag that we added to index.html properly connected script.js with index.html</li>
       <p>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</p>
       <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
       <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
       <li>What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
       <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
       <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types</li>
       <li>Sample code of an array : var topics = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Git', 'JavaScript'];
        for (var x = 0; x < topics.length; x++){
            console.log (topics[x]);</li>
       <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
       <li></li>
